Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

Example
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly

Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!


Problem:
- input: prompt user for four strings
  - a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective
- output:


=end

def madlib
  print "Enter a noun: "
  noun = gets.chomp
  print "Enter a verb: "
  verb = gets.chomp
  print "Enter an adjective: "
  adjective = gets.chomp
  print "Enter an adverb: "
  adverb = gets.chomp
  puts ''
  
  puts "Do you #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}? That's hilarious!"
end
