=begin
Given a string str, find the shortest possible string which can be achieved by adding characters to the end of initial string to make it a palindrome.

Example:
For str = "abcdc", the output should be "abcdcba".

str argument will be between 3 and 10 characters (inclusive)

Test cases:
build_palindrome("abcdc") == "abcdcba"
build_palindrome("ababab") == "abababa"
build_palindrome("accccc") == "accccca"
